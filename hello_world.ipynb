       "\n",
       "- **LangChain**: A modular Python framework that enables developers to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It supports various LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face, and offers tools for chaining prompts, managing memory, and integrating external tools. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen is an open-source framework that facilitates the creation of multi-agent conversations using LLMs. It allows for the orchestration of autonomous or human-in-the-loop AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks. ([lollypop.design](https://lollypop.design/blog/2025/june/ai-agent-frameworks/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **CrewAI**: An open-source framework designed for building autonomous multi-agent systems, CrewAI assigns specialized roles to each agent, enabling collaboration to complete complex tasks. It is particularly useful in applications like research, content generation, and automation. ([lollypop.design](https://lollypop.design/blog/2025/june/ai-agent-frameworks/?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **OpenAI Agents SDK**: Released in March 2025, this lightweight Python framework focuses on creating multi-agent workflows with comprehensive tracing and guardrails, facilitating the development of complex AI systems. ([datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/best-ai-agents?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "- **LangGraph**: An extension of LangChain, LangGraph allows developers to define agents as state machines, providing fine-grained control over agent state and supporting complex workflows with deterministic control, retries, and branching logic. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
